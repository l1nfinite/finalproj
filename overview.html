				<h3>Homepage</h3>
				<ul class="squarelist">
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">To avoid clutter and simply the website navigation, the three large icons on the homepage.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">Lectures, exercises/homework, and quizzes are featured on the homepage because those are the main reason as to why students would visit the course website.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">Large labels for each icon promotes ease of use and help lessen cognitive load.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">Icons and labels have a hover function that decreases the opacity. This is an interactive way to show the user some feedback.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">Main navigation is set horizontally at the top of the page. This allows more screen real estate for the content of the different pages.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">When hovering links, the colour transitions to yellow. This is a nice little interaction that shows the user some feedback.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class="textblock">Footer at the bottom contains the professor's name and contact information, along with links to "about the course", "resources", and links to my bcit, BCIT's website, and BCIT Computing.</p>
					</li>

				<h3>Lecture page</h3>
				<ul class="squarelist">
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Central page for all lecture notes and examples.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Navigation on the side is for the student to look through and find notes for current and past lectures. Students are not able to view upcoming lectures, because as the course progresses, the professor will add in the link to the newer lectures.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Page opens up to the current lecture of the week.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Hot links for the subheaders makes navigating easier, so the user would not have to scroll endlessly to look for topics.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Projector styling is only on the lecture page, as it is the page that's most likely to be shown through an overhead.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">In each lecture page, there is a prominent button that allows students to download exercise files from the lecture directly. The button shown in the proto-site is just a static example. Students can also find files to download in the session files page (homework and exercises page).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Exercises and homework</h3>
					<ul class="squarelist">
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">This is the central page for students to find files for class exercises, homework assignments, and projects. Having this page elements having to go to a particular lecture page and scroll through the content to find the downloadable files.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">The user can toggle between viewing class exercises and homework files. A simple hide/show JavaScript code was used to execute this interaction. This function eliminates clutter on one page.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Exercise section is blue and homework section is red. Colour coding helps with showing the user which section they are looking at.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Not all of the lecture exercise files and homework files are present, because as the course progresses, the professor will update the website with the newer materials.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Downloadable files are organized by lecture/homework numbers in a table to eliminate clutter.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Links to exercise files and homework files are named according to the topic, as oppose to having it labeled as just "exercise 1" or "homework 1". This will make it easier for students to find out exactly which files they want to download.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
			</article>

				<h3>Quizzes</h3>
				<ul class="squarelist">
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">This page displays a list of links for past, current, and future quizzes. It's a place for students to visit during in-class quizzes.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">The current quiz is highlighted with a dark blue background. This simplifies the process of looking through the list to determine which one is in progress.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">The list has alternating background colours to help the user navigate through the quizzes.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">Future quizzes are unlinked and greyed out with a line-through.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p class="textblock">The example online quiz is "quiz five", which uses a simple form for questions and answers. At the end of the quiz form, there is a prominent submit button for when the student completes it. Quiz five is just an example for the layout of a quiz; it is not a functioning form.</p>
